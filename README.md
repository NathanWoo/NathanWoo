### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nathan, a first-year master student studying __Computer Science__ at Columbia University. I am interested in Human and Computer Interaction and Accessibly. I earn my Bachelor degree in CS at UCSB, where I have participated in Eearly Research Scholar Program and studied how Virtual Reality could be used to facilitate peoplesâ€™ understanding on Environmental Science data.
