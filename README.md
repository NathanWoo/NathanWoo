### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nathan, a fourth-year student studying __Computer Science__ and __Statistics and Data Science__ (this is one major) at UCSB. I am interested in Human and Computer Interaction and Accessibly. Iâ€™m fascinated about how technology can help to solve real world issues and makes peopleâ€™s life more convenient. During my study at UCSB I have participated in ERSP where I studies how Virtual Reality can be used to facilitate peoplesâ€™ understanding on Environmental Science data. Checkout our groupâ€™s result [here]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hlMwbA6lATyMzwldB56foJHeYWUVL4B2/view). Currently, I am a research assistant at [Bionic Vision Lab](https://bionicvisionlab.org/) continuing my study on VR.
